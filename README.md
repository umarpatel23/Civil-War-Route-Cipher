# Civil-War-Route-Cipher
An encryption and decryption code message system utilizing the route cipher method from the American Civil War. Children could learn about the way in which wartime strategists encoded and decoded messages to prevent them from being understood by the enemy. These python scripts can be copied to any Python-supported IDE and the user interface will run in the console to allow kids to engage in a educational experience of creating fun code messages just like America's Civil War heroes did!
